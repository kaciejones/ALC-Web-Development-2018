            My name is Kacie Jones, I am a senior at Spanish Fork High School and will be graduating the spring of 2018. I have a strong passion for agriculture and my number one goal is to have a positive impact on the industry. I live on a farm just west of Spanish Fork, Utah, where I am responsible for a small herd of goats, several show pigs, and a half-acre garden. These projects are part of my Supervised Agricultural Experience, my project as an FFA member. Throughout the years I have seen the impact technology has on the agricultural industry, and in my future I hope to connect the two industries to not only make agriculture more successful, but also to help make it easier for the older generation to continue their productions. <br><br>
                
            Beginning in the Fall of 2018 I will pursue a degree in computer science at Southern Utah University. Following the completion of my degree I plan to find a career in software development or web development.
